    <h2>Method:</h2> <!--heading for method of how to make the recipe-->
    <ol> <!--use of <ol> and <li> tags to create a step by step guide on the dish-->
        <li>First create the tomato sauce: In a pan, heat oil and garlic over medium to high heat until the garlic starts to sizzle.<br> After, stir in tomatoes, basil, oregano and sugar, seasoning it with salt and pepper. Bring the pan to a simmer and cook the sauce slightly thickens. This typically takes 10 to 12 minutes<br>
        Then cover, keep warm and set aside. (Note: the sauce made will be good for two servings so set aside half for another time.)</li>
        <li>Next, to prepare the pasta, boil a large pot of salted water and place the spaghetti pasta inside, cooking it until al dente, or tender but firm when bitten. For spaghetti pasta this will usually take 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>To prepare the chicken, lay the chicken breasts between 2 plastic sheets and pound the chicken, using either a mallet or a pan until ¼ inches thick.</li>
        <li>After prepare the egg wash and breadcrumbs to bread the chicken with by beating an egg inside a shallow dish or small bowl unil well blended. In a separate plate or tray, season your breadcrumbs with black pepper.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven broiler to high and place a rack 4 to 5 inches from the heat source</li>
        <li>Dip each chicken cutlet in the beaten egg and then the breadcrumbs, lay the breaded cutlets in a clean wire rack over a cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Heat ¼ cup of oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium high heat until oil shimmers.</li>
        <li>Fry the cutlets inside the skillet until golden brown each side, typically about 5 minutes, then place the fried cutlets on the clean wire rack with the cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Top each cutlet with mozzarella and parmesan cheese and place inside the oven, broil until the cheese melts and becomes spotty brown, typically 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Portion pasta into 4 plates and add as much sauce as desired per person, add one chicken cutlet on top for each plate, optionally serve with extra parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
